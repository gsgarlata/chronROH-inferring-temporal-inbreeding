# Analysis of the simulated ROH-segments in a panmictic population with constant size or undergoing population size change 

This directory provides the scripts to process the simulated and inferred ROH-segments across all demographic models. The scripts reproduce the three plots:

* [chronROH True ROH-segments](fig_S1_chronROH_on_trueROHsegments_vs_trueFroh.R): it plots the *chronROH* of each simulated demographic model obtained by using the true ROH-segments (extracted from the tree-sequences of individuals sampled at present-day (t = 0)) and estimating their age (based on their true ROH-segment length) using the equation in Orkin et al., (2025).

* [chronROH Inferred ROH-segments](fig_S2_chronROH_on_inferredROHsegments_vs_trueFroh.R):
